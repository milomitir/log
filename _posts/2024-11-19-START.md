# START

Do all blogs need an obligatory 'first post' post? I'll make one anyways.

The internet has melted into a bubbling vat of commercial opportunity with snakes and rats swimming laps in the ooze. So, I'm taking the low road and making something nobody should care about, which is only to satisfy my own desire to put my words into the universe, with no expectations of engagement, feedback, or, worst of all, profit. This is about me, for me. My interests, my feelings, my whims, my projects, my best and worst can all live here. 

If you've found this personal log, welcome. How did you find it? That's a rhetorical question - I don't actually care.

I hope, to whoever may read this, that you are inspired to make a web log of your own, for yourself, beholden to nothing but your own whimsy. As it should be.
