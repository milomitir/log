### KEYBOARD

I got a [new keyboard](https://github.com/milomitir/milomitir/blob/main/_media/20241120-keyboard.jpg) yesterday - a Wooting 80HE. They're designed for fast-response needs in gaming, but I thought the variable actuation point and analog keypress features were cool enough to try it out for normal use. I definitely don't care enough about gaming to try and optimize my input device in that way, though I can see the appeal for the types of games that take advantage of the Rapid Trigger feature.

My previous keyboard was a pretty inexpensive Royal Kludge RK80 (I think was the name) with some type of brown switch - Khaile, maybe? I had modified it in a bunch of ways: taping the PCB, adding foam, and filling the chassis with silicone. It's still a good keyboard, but I snapped the stem of the ESC key while it was in my backpack, and I don't want to disassembling it with all the filling I've put in it to resolder a new one. I was using a software solution to remap ESC to the Pause key, but figured it was time to get a replacement. I've had the RK for probably 5 years at this point. 

The Wooting has linear switches, which I haven't used in probably a decade. They feel fine. It's also very quiet, which is nice. Overall, I like it, and it'll probably last me, well, probably the rest of my life, barring any catostrophic accident (liquid lol). 

As embarrassing as it is to say, it is genuinely pleasant to type with. Part of the reason I started this blog was just to give myself an excuse to type with it more. Although, I've wanted to start a blog for a while now, but I didn't like any of the typical platforms out there. When I found out GitHub had Pages, I looked into that and decided that I didn't actually need the Pages feature and would be fine using the repository as a "distribution method" without even needing to host a static webpage. Using the repo as the primary access method is also just kind of cool.
