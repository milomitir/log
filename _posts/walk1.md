# Pond Walk

Today I finally had the chance to get out and take a walk. I've been planning on going out to the train tracks and walking the line there for a while, but today I didn't quite have the time to do that. Instead, my plan was to go scope out the walk *to* the tracks and see if it would be easy to access. Turns out it was really straightforward to get there, and really didn't take that long. 

Still, there wasn't quite enough time to really walk the tracks, so I decided to cross them and head into the prairie on the other side. I wasn't sure if I was on private property at first, but after walking the length of it, there were some city limit signs and caution signs that I figure wouldn't be on private property. And while it was mown and bordered some farmland, but the other side of the strip I walked seemed mostly open and unused, so I think I was in the clear. Not like there was anyone nearby to actually see me, but it's nice to feel a bit more confident about where I went, because it turned out to be a beautiful little spot. 

There was a cool pond and a short treeline that had some huge trees dotting the edge of the pond area. A bald eagle was also perched on one of the trees which flew over the pond a couple times when I approached, whic was fun to see. There were a couple benches, some old firewood, and the remnants of tire tracks from a truck doing donuts where the waterline had receded, so I'm not entirely sure if that area is private or if others are just taking advantage of the space, kind of like I was.

Another time, I might go back and run some laps around the water on the exposed bed of the pond, since it's really clear and flat. It'd be a fun alternative to a treadmill that isn't actually a recreational track. 

I snapped a few photos while I was there:
